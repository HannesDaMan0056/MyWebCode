  <p>In today's rapidly changing business landscape, organizations face an increasing need for external resources with the right skills, competences, and experience to navigate
    these changes successfully. This is where Skillbased Consulting comes in as a valuable partner. We specialize in finding the right experts with the necessary skill sets and experience
    to help businesses and organizations transition smoothly.</p>
  <p>
    By adding resources with the relevant skill set and experience from working with the changes, you can reduce project risk, improve outcome to target, increase efficiency in solving
    problems, and deliver value, ultimately securing success in implementation.
  </p>
  <p>
    At Skillbased Consulting, we work with specialists and consultants with operational and implementation experience, typically found as independent contractors or in small to mid-size
    niche firms. We have built a network to find them, providing tools to display and make their specific skills searchable and presentable.
  </p>
  <p>
    We use digital profiling and matching tools in our process, proactively building and expanding our skill and competence network based on client needs and requirements. Our service
    model is based on skill-based delivery, providing expert advice and delivery through every step of the process. We conduct need analysis, search and match with skills and relevant
    experience in focus, and provide quality assurance through senior consultants as client responsible.

    At Skillbased Consulting, we recognize the challenges that niche consultants face in marketing their services and being found outside their network. We offer a free consultant
    profiling tool that enables them to leverage their skills and keep building experience while ensuring our clients find them through their skills and competence.

    Our digital profiling tools and processes proactively expand our network, focusing on skills and relevant experience to ensure quality matching. We strive to make the resourcing
    process more efficient for all parties in the market, enabling value-added solutions for clients and flexible business models that help consultants expand their proposition and find
    complementary resources when they own the client relationship.

    Currently, we are building the competence network for clients in Financial Services, Banking, and Insurance, and if this is your area of expertise, we invite you to register to become
    part of our network to get included in our search and matching.
