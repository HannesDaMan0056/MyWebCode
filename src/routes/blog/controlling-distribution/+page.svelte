    Controlling distribution is an important aspect of using Skillbased. When you create your profile or CV on Skillbased, you have complete control over who can see it. You can choose to share your
    CV profile with specific clients or employers, or you can keep it private and only share it when you're ready to apply for a specific job.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you share your profile or CV, it's sent out as a link, almost like a website. This link can be shared with anyone you choose, and you can also "un-share" the link if you no longer want it to
    be visible. Next time you decide to share it, a new unique link is created. This gives you complete control over your information and who has access to it.
  </p>
  <p>
    So if you're looking for a job or just want to showcase your skills to potential clients, Skillbased gives you the ability to control the distribution of your profile and CV. You can share it with
    the right people at the right time, increasing your chances of finding the perfect job or project.
