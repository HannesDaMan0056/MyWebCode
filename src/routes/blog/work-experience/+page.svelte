    When registering your work experiences and projects on Skillbased, it's important to be as detailed as possible and keep them updated. Here's what you need to know:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      The Work Experience section is where you can add your employment and main placeholder with information about your employer and role in the company. Additionally, you can add
      subordinated activities to a job, either internal or external, which are called projects.
    </li>
    <li>
      Each job and project is tagged with industry, functional area, and career level to increase accuracy in matching and presenting your specific competences.
    </li>
    <li>
      Tag skills to each job or project where the skill was used and acquired. This will help others understand your areas of expertise and increase your chances of being matched with
      relevant projects and opportunities.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you are employed as a consultant, it is important to enter consulting assignments as external projects, performed in the clients' industry and organization.
    </li>
    <li>
      In the job or project description field, write briefly about your role and responsibilities, and give more focus to the results of your achievements and contribution. This will
      help potential clients understand the impact you've had in your past roles and projects.
    </li>
    <li>
      Skills can be self-rated with the current level of expertise and range of years practiced. You can update and administer skills in the Skill section, where you can also overview
      which jobs or projects you have tagged them to.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    By following these guidelines and keeping your work experiences and projects updated, you'll increase your chances of being matched with relevant opportunities and showcasing your
    specific competences to potential clients.
